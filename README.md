## Overview

This repo is exploratory, idiosyncratic, and not intended as a universal template.  
But if you enjoy turning black-box appliances into programmable interfaces - welcome.

## Philosophy

This repository implements a simple GitOps approach for managing my home infrastructure: desired state is defined in [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform), versioned in Git, and applied through automated workflows.
